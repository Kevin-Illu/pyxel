# 2D Game Development with Python and Pyxel

## Description

This repository contains my journey of learning to create 2D games using Python and Pyxel. Here, you will find various projects and experiments as I develop my skills in game development. Each project represents a step in my learning process, from simple prototypes to more complex games.

## Projects

- **Project 1: Hello Pyxel**
  - A basic project to get familiar with the Pyxel library.
- **Project 2: Moving Character**
  - An experiment with character movement and control.
- **Project 3: Simple Platformer**
  - A basic platformer game to understand collision detection and physics.
- **Project 4: Shooting Game**
  - A project to learn about shooting mechanics and enemy behavior.
- **Project 5: Final Game**
  - A more complex game combining all the learned concepts.

## Installation

To run the projects in this repository, you need to have Python and Pyxel installed.

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install Pyxel using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pyxel
   ```
